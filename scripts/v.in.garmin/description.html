<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.in.garmin</em> allows the user to import waypoint, route, and track
 data from a locally connected Garmin GPS receiver via the 
<em><a href="http://gpstrans.sourceforge.net">gpstrans</a></em>
 program by Carsten Tschach or the
<em><a href="http://www.snafu.org">gardump</a></em>
 program by Marc Hyman. 

<h2>NOTES</h2>
If the GPS is set up to output WGS84 Lat/Lon, <em>v.in.garmin</em> will
attempt to automatically transform the coordinates to the current projection.
In all other cases, no checks are performed for datum, projection and format of data.
You must check for yourself that your receiver, gpstrans and GRASS
use the same map datum and projection.
The automatic transform may be skipped by using the <b>-k</b> flag.

<p>
Route and Track data may be uploaded as points by using the <em>-p</em> flag, 
otherwise they will be imported as a line. You can run <em>v.in.garmin</em>
multiple times and merge the line and point vectors with the <em>v.patch</em>
command if you want, but take care when merging dissimilar attribute tables.

<p>
Future versions of GRASS will use <em>gardump</em> as the default download
program. It can talk to newer Garmin GPSs, while <em>gpstrans</em> seems to
be mostly abandoned these days and only works with older GPSs. The current
version of <em>gardump</em> (ver 2.5) will not yet talk to USB-only GPSs, but
you can try the <em>v.in.gpsbabel</em> module for those. The <em>gardump</em>
code has been tested with an older Garmin GPS 45 and a newer GPS V and is
expected to work with everything in between.

<p>
Before running <em>v.in.garmin</em>, <em>gpstrans</em> should be set up 
to output WGS84 latitude-longitude, as follows: <br>
<tt>
$ <b>gpstrans -s</b><br>
datum:  100 (WGS84)<br>
format: 2 - lat/lon  ddd.ddddd<br>
</tt>
