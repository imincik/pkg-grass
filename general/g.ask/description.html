<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>g.ask</em> is designed for shell scripts that need to
prompt the user for the name of a data base file in the
user's current GRASS location.  After <em>g.ask</em> is
invoked with needed parameters, it will query the user for
a file name of the specified <em>type</em> and
<em>element</em>.  After the user responds to this query,
the program will write four lines to the UNIX output file
specified by <em>unixfile</em>.

<!-- unused
<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<h3>Parameters:</h3>


<dl>


<dt><b>type=</b><em>name</em> 

<dd>The type of query.  Options for <em>name</em> are 
<em>old</em>, <em>new</em>,
<em>any</em>, and <em>mapset</em>;  their functions are given below.
"New", "any", and "mapset" only look in the user's current mapset.

<dl>
<dd>
<dt><b>old</b>
<dd>For existing data files anywhere in the user's mapset search path.

<dt><b>new</b> 

<dd>Used to create a new file in the current mapset, which must not
already exist there (if a file with this name exists there,
it will not be overwritten).

<dt><b>any</b> 

<dd>Creates a file in the current mapset, which may or may not
already exist there.  If a file with this name exists in the
current mapset, it will be overwritten;
if not, a new file with this name will be created.

<dt><b>mapset</b> 

<dd>For files that must exist in the current mapset
The shell write wants the name of a file which exists
in the user's current mapset.  This type would
used instead of "old" if the file is to be modified.
</dl>

<dt><b>prompt=</b>"<em>string</em>" 

<dd>The prompt to be displayed to the user.  If more than
one word, the prompt should be enclosed within double
quotes ("").

<dt><b>element=</b><em>name</em> 

<dd>The name of the GRASS data base element (i.e.,
directory under a GRASS mapset) whose files are to be
queried.

<dt><b>desc=</b>"<em>string</em>" 

<dd>A short description of the data base element which is
meaningful to the user.  If description contains more than
one word, it should be enclosed within double quotes ("").

<dt><b>unixfile=</b><em>name</em> 

<dd>The name of a UNIX file to store the user's response.
See next section for what is written to this file and how
it can be used by shell scripts.

</dl>

<h2>OUTPUT</h2>

Upon receiving the user's response to its request for a
file name, <em>g.ask</em> writes four lines to the
specified <em>unixfile</em>; this output file is placed in
the user's current working directory, unless otherwise
specified, and contains the following lines:


<div class="code">
<PRE>
name='<em>some_name</em>'
mapset='<em>some_mapset</em>'
fullname='<em>some_fullname</em>'
file='<em>some_fullpath</em>'
</pre></div>

<p>

The output is <em>/bin/sh</em> commands to set the variable
<em>name</em> to the file name specified by the user (of
the <em>element</em> and <em>type</em> requested by
<em>g.ask</em>), <em>mapset</em> to the GRASS mapset in
which this file resides (or will be created),
<em>fullname</em> is the name with the mapset embedded in
it, and <em>file</em> to the full UNIX path name
identifying this file.  These variables may be set in the
<em>/bin/sh</em> as follows:

<dl>
<dd>
<b>. unixfile</b>
</dl>


<p>

The . is a shell command which means read the
<em>unixfile</em> and execute the commands found there.  It
is NOT part of the <em>unixfile</em> name and MUST be
followed by a space.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The user may choose to simply hit the return key and not enter a file name.
If this happens the variables will be set as follows:


<div class="code">
<PRE>
name=
mapset=
fullname=
file=
</pre></div>

<p>

The following is a way to test for this case:

<div class="code">
<PRE>
if [ ! "$file" ]
then
	exit
fi
</PRE></div>
