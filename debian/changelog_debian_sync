grass (6.4.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ready for unstable.
  * Removed pre-release patches inserted in the squeeze latest upload.

  * Merged from 6.4.0-1 in experimental:
      - Added missing docs used by GUIs: AUTHORS, contributors CSV files,
        COPYING and a symlink to GPL-2 license in /usr/share/common-licenses.
        Those files need to be symlinked in GISBASE to be found at run-time.
        Thanks AlanB and Hamish for pointing the problem.
        (closes: #594492)
      - New upstream final release 6.4.0.
      - Note that now default interface is the wx one, so (wx)python related suggestions
        have been promoted to proper dependencies. For the same reason I would
        consider cut/paste problems of the past Tk interface obsolete.
        (closes: #305249)
      - Policy bumped to 3.9.1. No changes required.
      - Added libgdal1-dev dep to grass-dev list of dependencies.
        (closes: #598706)

grass (6.4.0~rc6+42329-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merging main fixes taken from final 6.4.0 release. The big patch has been
    splitted in a few sub-patches for specific improvements.
        + localization.dpatch: updates to .po files.
        + doc.dpatch: various documentation fixes with update to main URL too. 
        + gcs.dpatch: Port GDAL's http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/changeset/19810 
              to fix missing towsg84 for EPSG codes: 3120 2172 2173 2174 2175 
              3333 3334 3335 3329 3330 3331 3332 3328 4179. 
              It also forces ETRS89 datum to be
              interpreted as 0,0,0,0,0,0,0 instead of 0.000,0.000,0.000 (i.e.
              overrides the datum.table ETRS89 setting, too). More info:
              http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2010-June/050918.html,
              http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/3579.
        + g.extension.dpatch: added Markus g.extension script to download and
          eventually install extension from GRASS svn add-ons repo.
        + scripts.dpatch: some fixes to a blounce of scripts: 
                m.proj - added GUI section
                r.mask - allow r.mask to work in GISDBASE
                v.in.gpsbabel - fixed broken awk statement
                v.in.mapgen - better describe what v.in.mapgen will load
                r.regression.line -  rename variable from italian so it 
                     doesn't get confused with median, add F-test to key
        + g.proj: only split at space characters if there is a + character
                  following
        + clean_nodes: in Vlib fixes segfault when cleaning small angles 
                   at nodes
        + read_sig.c: catch empty sig files
        + convert.c: added non-standard datum name lookup
        + r.grow.distance: bugfix for distance calculation
        + geom.c: fixes bug for min_area
        + flythrough: fixes NVIZ fly mode on 64bit. See #46 from upstream trac.
        + filldepr.cc: r.terraflow: backport fix for #1006 from upstream trac.
  * Added missing docs used by GUIs: AUTHORS, contributors CSV files, 
    COPYING and a symlink to GPL-2 license in /usr/share/common-licenses.
    Those files need to be symlinked in GISBASE to be found at run-time.

  * New upstream snapshot taken from 6.4 branch. 
  * Removed patch newlocation.dpatch, merged upstream.
  * Grass is currently not compatible with swig 1.3.39, which causes wxpython

    for a discussion about GIS_H_VERSION. This trick should hopefully avoid
    unnoticed breakages for plugins and Qgis. Basically, forces rebuilding of
    gdal-grass or qgis at every new Grass release.

grass (6.4.0~rc5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a grass menu item (Hamish).

  * Added proj-bin among Suggests in debian/control.
  * Moved build-dep from proj to libproj-dev.
  * Grass-doc section set to doc instead of science.
  * Added a libgdal.so link to the system GDAL shlib, to allow external raster/vector
    support to work.
  * Policy bumped to 3.8.1, without changes.
  * Introduced grassVERSION and grassVERSION-dev Provides and debian/control.in 
    templates to get grass major.minor versions automagically. 
    The new field is useful to introduce per-version dependency in external 
    plugins: mixing fluxes^Wversions is evil, and currently gdal-grass could 
    be installed with the wrong grass release.
  * Now fixscripts.sh get automagically grass version for its paths.
  * Added new files to fixscripts.sh to avoid a bounce of lintian warnings.
  * Now all debian/ files are templated against grass version, to avoid

  * Obsolete NEWS file removed.
  * Removed pre-lenny compatibility build-deps.
  * Debhelper level moved to 7, now using dh_prep.
  * Removed ld.so file installation. Grass programs must be called under Grass environment,
    so it is pointless and can be dangerous when different versions are installed. This
    is also true for Qgis and its Grass plugin. As consequence postinst and postrm files 
    have been removed as obsolete.
  * Fixed htmlgen-fakeroot.dpatch, incredibly broken without notice. 
  * Cleaned debian/control.

  * Merging relevant changes in the stable 6.2.3 tree with the experimental DebianGis series:

  	From 6.2.3-3:
        o Fixated patch rule.

        From 6.2.3-2:
        o Added libfftw3-dev build-dep to reflect current library name.
          (it closed: #458232)
        o Upstream already fixed v.db.update as suggested.
          (it closed: #434897)

        From: 6.2.3-1:
  	o Updated obsolete ${Source-Version} to ${binary:Version}.
  	o Fixed lintian error: : debian-rules-ignores-make-clean-error
  	o Now using mysql_config to get MySQL includes path.
  	o Added private library path at dh_shlibdeps call.

grass (6.0.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make libgrass depend on current version of grass.
    libgrass requires files in the main package and doesn't
    yet stand alone.

  [ Francesco Paolo Lovergine ]

    This is still sub-optimal...

  * Added Module.make among -dev files.
    (closes: #315073)

grass (6.0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Paul Wise ]

  * Add homepage to package descriptions

  [ Francesco Paolo Lovergine ]

  * Transitioned to libmysqlclient15-dev in control (but retained old lib-dev pkg for backports )
    (closes: #343817)
  * Transitioned to libgdal1-1.3.1 for new gdal packaging scheme due to C++ ABI/API instability.
  * Typo with a exceeding ` at configure(1333) corrected (upstream cvs is ok).
    Issue definitively depends on shell version.

    manual and used upstream one for grass main script.
