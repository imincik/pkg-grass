<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.buffer</em> creates a buffer around features of given <b>type</b>, which
have a category in the given <b>layer</b>. The <b>tolerance</b> controls
the number of vector segments being generated (the smaller the value, the more
vector segments are generated).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Attributes are not transferred due to potential buffer overlap, which
cannot be resolved automatically.
<p>
The input vector must be reasonably clean: lines must not intersect
themselves. It is recommended to clean the input vector first with
<em>v.clean tool=snap,break,rmdupl</em> and then create buffers. The 
snapping threshold depends on the digitization threshold and the desired 
buffering distance. As a rule of thumb, the snapping distance can be 
up to 1% of the buffering distance.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h3>Buffer around input lines</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.buffer input=map output=buffer type=line buffer=100
</pre></div>

<h3>Circles around input points</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.buffer input=pointsmap output=circles type=point buffer=1000 
</pre></div>

<h3>Non-overlapping circles around input points with attribute transfer</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.buffer input=archsites output=circles type=point buffer=200 
# change original points to centroids: 
v.type in=archsites out=archcentroids type=point,centroid 
# patch circles and centroids: 
v.patch in=archcentroids,circles out=circles_db 
# attach attributes, either use 
# db.copy ... 
# or link to the original table: 
v.db.connect map=circles_db table=archsites field=1 key=cat driver=dbf \
database='$GISDBASE/$LOCATION_NAME/$MAPSET/dbf'
</pre></div>

<h2>BUGS</h2>

For some data <em>v.buffer</em> can produce strange results, especially if
the buffer size is bigger than input features. Usually you can solve the
problem if you run <em>v.buffer</em> more times with smaller buffer.
<p>
The <b>bufcol</b> dynamic buffer distance parameter has problems cleaning
complex features (holes left filled, etc.). If you experience problems, try
running <em>v.buffer</em> multiple times with a single buffer distance, patch
the results with <em>v.patch</em> and remove any overlaps with 
<em>v.extract -d</em>.
