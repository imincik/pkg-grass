AUTHORS:
The orthophoto rectification programs went out under alpha in 4.0.
It has since had bug fixes performed by OGI (Shapiro?) and also by
the original programmer - Mike Baba of DBA Systems, Fairfax, VA.

The main program is i.ortho.photo which is just a menu driver for the 
following programs:

1 i.group
2 i.photo.target
3 i.photo.init
4 i.photo.camera
5 i.photo.elev
6 i.photo.2image
7 i.photo.2target
8 i.photo.rectify



The following directories contain the source code:

	./menu:			main menu code       (-> menu/menu.c)

	./i.photo.target:		select target location and mapset

	./i.photo.elev:		select elevation model
 
	./i.photo.camera:		select a camera to use for parameters

	./i.photo.2image:		code for image to photo coordinate
				transformation

	./i.photo.init:		choose initial camera exposure station
				parameters

	./i.photo.2target:	computes photo to target location
				transformation paramters

	./i.photo.rectify:	does the actual image rectification
	
	./libes:		libraries for ortho programs
