<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
This numerical program calculates transient, confined and
unconfined groundwater flow in two dimensions based on  
raster maps and the current region resolution.
All initial and boundary conditions must be provided as 
raster maps.

<p>

<em>r.gwflow</em> calculates the piezometric head and optionally the 
filter velocity field, based on the hydraulic conductivity and the piezometric head. 
The vector components can be visualized with paraview if they are exported
with <em>r.out.vtk</em>.
<br>
<br>
The groundwater flow will always be calculated transient. 
If you want to calculate stady state, set the timestep 
to a large number (billions of seconds) or set the 
specific yield/ effective porosity raster maps to zero.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

The groundwater flow calculation is based on Darcy's law and a 
finite volume discretization. The solved groundwater flow partial 
differential equation is of the following form:

<p>
(dh/dt)*Ss = Kxx * (d^2h/dx^2) + Kyy * (d^2h/dy^2) + q

<ul>
<li>h -- the piezometric head im [m]</li>
<li>dt -- the time step for transient calculation in [s]</li>
<li>S -- the specific yield [1/m]</li>
<li>Kxx -- the hydraulic conductivity tensor part in x direction in [m/s]</li>
<li>Kyy -- the hydraulic conductivity tensor part in y direction in [m/s]</li>
<li>q - inner source in meter per second [1/s]</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
Two different boundary conditions are implemented, 
the Dirichlet and Neumann conditions. By default the calculation area is surrounded by homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions.
The calculation and boundary status of single cells must be set with a status map, 
the following states are supportet:

<ul>
<li>0 == inactive - the cell with status 0 will not be calculated, active cells will have a no flow boundary to this cell</li>
<li>1 == active - this cell is used for groundwater floaw calculation, inner sources and recharge can be defined for those cells</li>
<li>2 == Dirichlet - cells of this type will have a fixed piezometric head value which do not change over the time </li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
The groundwater flow equation can be solved with several solvers.
Two iterative solvers with sparse and quadratic matrices support are implemented.
The conjugate gradients (cg) method and the biconjugate gradients-stabilized (bicgstab) method. 
Additionally a direct Gauss solver and LU solver are available. Those direct solvers
only work with normal quadratic matrices, so be careful using them with large maps 
(maps of size 10.000 cells will need more than one gigabyte of RAM).
Always prefer a sparse matrix solver.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
Use this small script to create a working
groundwater flow area and data. Make sure you are not in a lat/lon projection.
