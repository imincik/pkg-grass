<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>


<em>r.proj</em> projects a raster map in a specified mapset of a
specified location from the projection of the input location to a raster map
in the current location. The projection information is taken from the
current PROJ_INFO files, as set with <i><a href="g.setproj.html">g.setproj</a>
</i> and viewed with <i><a href="g.proj.html">g.proj</a></i>.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<h4>Map projections</h4>

Map projections are a method of representing information from a
curved surface (usually a spheroid) in two dimensions, typically to allow
indexing through cartesian coordinates.  There are a wide variety of
projections, with common ones divided into a number of classes, including
cylindrical and pseudo-cylindrical, conic and pseudo-conic, and azimuthal
methods, each of which may be conformal, equal-area, or neither.  
<p>
The particular projection chosen depends on the purpose of the project,
and the size, shape and location of the area of interest.  For example,
normal cylindrical projections are good for maps which are of greater extent
east-west than north-south and in equatorial regions, while conic
projections are better in mid-latitudes;  transverse cylindrical projections
are used for maps which are of greater extent north-south than east-west;
azimuthal projections are used for polar regions.  Oblique versions of any
of these may also be used.  Conformal projections preserve angular
relationships, and better preserve arc-length, while equal-area projections
are more appropriate for statistical studies and work in which the amount of
material is important.  
<p>
Projections are defined by precise mathematical relations, so the method
of projecting coordinates from a geographic reference frame
(latitude-longitude) into a projected cartesian reference frame (eg metres)
is governed by these equations.  Inverse projections can also be achieved. 
The public-domain Unix software package <i>PROJ</i> [1] has been designed to
perform these transformations, and the user's manual contains a detailed
description of over 100 useful projections.  This also includes a
programmers library of the projection methods to support other software
development.  
<p>
Thus, converting a vector map - in which objects are located
with arbitrary spatial precision - from one projection into another is
usually accomplished by a simple two-step process:  first the location of
all the points in the map are converted from the source through an inverse
projection into latitude-longitude, and then through a forward projection
into the target.  (Of course the procedure will be one-step if either the
source or target is in geographic coordinates.)
<p>
Converting a raster map, or image, between different projections, 
however, involves additional considerations.  
A raster may be considered to represent a sampling of a
process at a regular, ordered set of locations.  The set of locations that
lie at the intersections of a cartesian grid in one projection will not, in
general, coincide with the sample points in another projection.  Thus, the
conversion of raster maps involves an interpolation step in which the values
of points at intermediate locations relative to the source grid are
estimated.

<h5>Projecting vector maps within the GRASS GIS</h5>
<!-- move this into v.proj.html !! -->
GIS data capture, import and transfer often requires a projection
step, since the source or client will frequently be in a different
projection to the working projection.
<p>
In some cases it is convenient to do the conversion outside the package,
prior to import or after export, using software such as <i>PROJ.4</i>'s
<i><a href="http://proj.maptools.org/">cs2cs</a></i> [1]. This is an easy
method for converting an ASCII file containing a list of coordinate points,
since there is no topology to be preserved and <i>cs2cs</i> can be used to
process simple lists using a one-line command.
<p>
The format of files containg vector maps with <b>lines</b> and <b>arcs</b> is
generally more complex, as parts of the data stored in the files will describe
topology, and not just coordinates. In GRASS GIS the
<i><a href="v.proj.html">v.proj</a></i> module is provided to reproject
vector maps, transferring topology and attributes as well as node coordinates.
This program uses the projection definition and parameters which are stored in
the PROJ_INFO and PROJ_UNITS files in the PERMANENT mapset directory for every
GRASS location.

<h3>Design of r.proj</h3>

As discussed briefly above, the fundamental step in re-projecting a
raster is resampling the source grid at locations corresponding to the
intersections of a grid in the target projection. The basic procedure for
accomplishing this, therefore, is as follows:
<p>
<em>r.proj</em> converts a map to a new geographic projection. It reads a
map from a different location, projects it and write it out to the current
location.
<br>
The projected data is resampled with one of three different methods: 
nearest neighbor, bilinear and cubic convolution.
<p>
The <em>method=nearest</em>, which performs a nearest neighbor assignment,
is the fastest of the three resampling methods. It is primarily used for
categorical data such as a land use classification, since it will not change
the values of the data cells. The <em>method=bilinear</em> determines the new
value of the cell based on a weighted distance average of the 4 surrounding
cells in the input map. The <em>method=cubic</em> determines the new value of
the cell based on a weighted distance average of the 16 surrounding cells in
the input map.
<p>
The bilinear and cubic interpolation methods are most appropriate for
continuous data and cause some smoothing. Both options should not be used
with categorical data, since the cell values will be altered.
<p>
If nearest neighbor assignment is used, the output map has the same raster
format as the input map. If any of the both interpolations is used, the
output map is written as floating point.

<p>
Note that, following normal GRASS conventions, the coverage and
resolution of the resulting grid is set by the current region settings,
which may be adjusted using <i>g.region</i>.  The target raster will be
relatively unbiased for all cases if its grid has a similar resolution to
the source, so that the resampling/interpolation step is only a local
operation.  If the resolution is changed significantly, then the behaviour
of the generalisation or refinement will depend on the model of the process
being represented.  This will be very different for categorical versus
numerical data.  Note that three methods for the local interpolation step
are provided.

<p>
<em>r.proj</em> supports general datum transformations, making use of the
<em>PROJ.4</em> co-ordinate system translation library.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

If <b>output</b> is not specified it is set to be the same as input map
name.

<br>
If <b>mapset</b> is not specified, its name is assumed to be the same
as the current mapset's name.

<br>
If <b>dbase</b> is not specified it is assumed to be the current
database. The user only has to specify <b>dbase</b> if the source
location is stored in another separate GRASS database.

<p>
To avoid excessive time consumption when reprojecting a map the region and 
resolution of the target location should be set appropriately beforehand.
A simple way to do this is to generate a vector "box" map of the region in  
the source location using <em><a href="v.in.region.html">v.in.region</a></em>.
This "box" map is then reprojected into the target location with
<em><a href="v.proj.html">v.proj</a></em>.
Next the region in the target location is set to the extent of the new vector
map with <em><a href="g.region.html">g.region</a></em> along with the desired
raster resolution (<em>g.region -m</em> can be used in Latitude/Longitude
locations to measure the geodetic length of a pixel).
<em>r.proj</em> is then run for the raster map the user wants to reproject.
In this case a little preparation goes a long way.
<p>
When reprojecting whole-world maps the user should disable map-trimming with
the <em>-n</em> flag. Trimming is not useful here because the module has the
whole map in memory anyway. Besides that, world "edges" are hard (or
impossible) to find in projections other than latitude-longitude so results
may be odd with trimming.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<div class="code"><pre>

# In the source location, use v.in.region to generate a bounding box around the
# region of interest:

v.in.region output=bounds type=area

# Now switch to the target location and import the vector bounding box 
# (you can run v.proj -l to get a list of vector maps in the source location):

v.proj input=bounds location=source_location_name output=bounds_reprojected

# Set the region in the target location with that of the newly-imported vector
# bounds map, and align the resolution to the desired cell resolution of the 
# final, reprojected raster map:

g.region vect=bounds_reprojected res=5 -a

# Now reproject the raster into the target location

r.proj input=elevation.dem output=elevation.dem.reproj \
location=source_location_name mapset=PERMANENT res=5 method=cubic
</pre></div>
