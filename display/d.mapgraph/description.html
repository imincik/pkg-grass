<h3>
This module is superseded and scheduled for demolition.
<br>Please use "<em><a href="d.graph.html">d.graph</a>
<b>-m</b></em>" instead.</h3>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>d.mapgraph</em> draws graphics that are described in
standard input (default) or the UNIX input file
<em>name</em>. If commands are entered via standard
input, a <em>ctrl-d</em> is used to signal the end of input
to <em>d.mapgraph</em>. This program performs
essentially the same function as 
<em><a href="d.graph.html">d.graph</a></em>; however,
point locations are specified to <em>d.mapgraph</em> in the
geographic coordinate system of the user's current mapset
and location (i.e., in map coordinates), rather than in
graphics display screen coordinates.

<p>

The program can be run interactively or non-interactively.
The user can run the program completely non-interactively
by specifying the name of a file containing
<em>d.mapgraph</em> graphics commands and the values of all
needed parameters on the command line.  The user can
instead elect to run the program partially interactively,
by specifying any/all of the parameters <em>except</em> the
graphics <b>input=</b><em>name</em> parameter on the
command line.  In this case, <em>d.mapgraph</em> will
expect the user to input <em>d.mapgraph</em> graphics
commands from standard input (i.e., the keyboard) and will
(silently) prompt the user for these graphics commands.
Alternately, the user can simply type <b>d.mapgraph</b> on
the command line, and be prompted for the values of all
parameters (the user can still input graphics commands from
an input file using this form.) In this case, the user is
presented with the standard GRASS 
<em><a href="g.parser.html">g.parser</a></em> interface.

<p>
<em>d.mapgraph</em> is used for drawing simple graphics on
top of map layers.  The coordinate system used by
<em>d.mapgraph</em> is the same as that of the map layer
displayed in the active display frame on the graphics
monitor (or that of the user's current region, if no map is
displayed).

<p>
The graphics language is simple and uses the following commands: 

<dl>

<dt><b>#</b> <em>comment</em> 

<dd>A line of comment which is ignored in the processing. 

<dt><b>move</b> <em>xpos ypos</em> 

<dd>The current location is updated to <em>xpos ypos</em>
(where these, respectively, are the easting and northing of
geographic coordinates stated in the map coordinate system
of the user's current GRASS location, falling within the
current region and active frame).  If unspecified by the
user, the current location becomes (0,0).  If, as most
likely, the point (0,0) falls outside of the user's current
region, graphics drawn there will not appear in the
graphics frame.

<p>

Note: use <em><a href="g.region.html">g.region</a></em>
to obtain the coordinates of current location.  Use <em>
<a href="d.where.html">d.where</a></em> to obtain specific
map coordinates of various points on the raster map
displayed in the active frame.

<br>

Note: there must be a space between <em>xpos</em> and <em>ypos</em>.

<dt><b>draw</b> <em>xpos ypos</em> 

<dd>A line is drawn in the current color from the current
location to the new location <em>xpos ypos</em>, which then
becomes the current location.  <em>xpos</em> and
<em>ypos</em> are (respectively) an easting and northing
stated in the map coordinate system of the user's current
GRASS location, and located within the user's current
geographic region and active frame.

<p>

Note: there must be a space between <em>xpos</em> and <em>ypos</em>.

<dt><b>color</b> <em>color</em> 

<dd>Sets the current color to that stated. 
Color options are: <em>red</em>, 
<em>orange</em>, 
<em>yellow</em>, 
<em>green</em>, 
<em>blue</em>, 
<em>indigo</em>, 
<em>violet</em>,
<em>magenta,</em> 
<em>brown</em>, 
<em>gray</em>,
<em>white</em>, 
<em>black</em>,
an R:G:B triplet (separated by colons),
or the word "none" (draws in the default background color).

<dt><b>size</b> <em>xper yper</em>

<dd>Subsequent text will be drawn such that the text is
<em>xper</em> percent of the display frame's width and
<em>yper</em> percent of the display frame height.  If not
specified by the user, the text size becomes 5 percent of
the active frame's width and 5 percent of the frame's
height.  This is equivalent to entering <b>size 5 5</b>.

<dt><b>text</b> <em>line-of-text</em> 

<dd>The stated text is drawn at the current location using
the current color and the current size.

<dt><b>icon</b> <em>type size x y</em> 

<dd>Draws an icon of types o, x, or + with specified size
at location x,y.  Note: type o designates a square.

<dt><b>polygon</b> <br>
<em> xpos ypos</em> <br>
<em> xpos ypos</em> <br>
. <br>
. <br>
. <br>

<dd>The map coordinates appearing on lines beneath the word
<em>polygon</em>, one pair per line, circumscribe a
polygon which is to be filled with the current color.

</dl>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<em>d.mapgraph</em> is identical to the 
<em><a href="d.graph.html">d.graph</a></em> command, except for the 
difference in coordinate systems used. In the future functionality will
be merged into <em>d.graph</em> and <em>d.mapgraph</em> will be removed.

<p>

<em>d.mapgraph</em> will complain if the user enters
something to standard input that it does not understand.
Blank lines in the input file will result in this error
message.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

Draw some text in the center of the display:
<pre>
   EAST=`g.region -c | grep east | cut -f2 -d:`
   NORTH=`g.region -c | grep north | cut -f2 -d:`

   d.mapgraph << EOF
     move $EAST $NORTH
     text GRASS
   EOF
</pre>
