# List all extensions here on which your own extension depends.
# The install routine will check if these are installed before
# installing yours.
# Each line should have <extension name> and <major.minor.revision>
# tokens, separated by tabs.
# E.g.:
#
# myExtension	1.0.2
#
# If extension name is "GRASS", the install routine will check that
# the correct GRASS version is present:
#
# GRASS	6.0.1
#
# You can put in commented and empty lines if you wish, as well as
# end-of-line comments, e.g.:
#
# GRASS	6.0.1	# due to some bugs in 6.0.0
#
# If you leave out the version number, or parts of it, every missing
# part will be interpreted as "0" by the install routine.
