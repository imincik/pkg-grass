# This will register modules in GIS manager's pull-down menu
# under the "Extensions" menu by modifying (GISBASE)/etc/dm/menu.tcl
#
# The first line MUST start with a submenu name in [brackets]. This
# will create the extension's submenu under "Extensions".
# Extensions cannot create entries directly in the "Extensions" menu
#
# Each other line consists of two tokens that MUST be separated with ';'
# The last token specifies the command to be called
#
# Use a simple '-' to get a separator line
#
# For command specifiers, prefix either "execute" or "term"
#
# E.g.:
#
#[Viewshed Analysis]
#Calculate cumulative viewsheds;execute r.cva
