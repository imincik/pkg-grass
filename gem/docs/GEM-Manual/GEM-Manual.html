<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<DIV>
GRASS 6 Extensions Manager (GEM) is a small stand-alone program intended
to make it easy for GRASS GIS users to download, compile and install
additional GRASS modules. GEM manages source code, scripts and pre-compiled
binaries in a simple file layout called an <I>extension</I>. Extensions
are accompanied by a set of ASCII files that store all relevant information
including dependencies on other extensions or specific GRASS versions.
Extensions can be stored conveniently in a single compressed archive
file, a so-called <I>extension package</I> using external programs
such as tar and gzip. An extension (package) can be created easily
by copying existing source codes into the right places of a skeleton
file layout and filling in some information in simple, commented ASCII
files. Makefiles written for GRASS 6 should work with minimal changes
as GEM uses a simplified version of the orginal GRASS make system.

<P>
This Document provides instructions for using GEM and for writing
portable GRASS extensions to be installed with GEM.

1 Why Do I Need GEM?</A>
</H1>

<P>
GRASS GIS (www.grass.itc.it) is a powerful, modularized open
source Geographic Information System. The base distribution comes
with hundreds of useful modules. However, there are a few flaws in
the design:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Installation of add-on modules that are not part of the main distribution
(http://grass.gdf-hannover.de/twiki/bin/view/GRASS/GrassAddOns)
is tedious. It requires a full copy of the GRASS source codes. Add-on
sources must be copied to the right locations, compilation and installation
must then be started as though one was to install the whole system
from scratch.
</LI>
<LI>Users willing to install add-on functionality must have at least a
basic knowledge of how to compile and install modules from C source
code.
</LI>
<LI>The sheer number of modules makes it hard to find the one that has
exactly the functionality needed. There is no thematic grouping of
modules. This becomes worse as more add-on modules are installed.
</LI>
<LI>Developers of add-on functionality currently have no way to make this
process more user-friendly. Add-on developers as a rule write modules
that are functionaly closely related. These should be grouped and
distributed as a package along with some over-arching documentation
to bind them together and make them more accessible from a user's
perspective.
</LI>
<LI>Some add-ons modules exist in the official CVS and in another place
such as the developer's homepage. For a user, it is hard to know which
version is more current. In fact, GRASS has no versioning scheme except
for the base distribution itself.
</LI>
</OL>
GEM, the GRASS Extensions Manager, was developed as an open source
solution to address all of these issues. It is a tool that simplifies
development, distribution and installation of additional modules (extensions)
for GRASS GIS (version 6.0 and above).

<P>
From the GRASS user's perspective GEM can be used to:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Conveniently download and install add-on GRASS modules (extensions)
that are not part of the CVS.
</LI>
<LI>Avoid having to keep a complete GRASS source tree on the disk for
installing new functionality.
</LI>
<LI>Install add-on modules from provided binaries without the need to
have any development tools installed.
</LI>
<LI>Manage installed extensions: query, update, uninstall them.
</LI>
</UL>
Form the GRASS developer's perspective GEM allows for:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Development of GRASS modules completely outside the CVS tree. In a
dedicated directory that is much easier to maintain and sync.
</LI>
<LI>Packaging of module source code, documentation and pre-compiled binaries
and deployment as a single file (extension package).
</LI>
<LI>Simple outsourcing of sets of GRASS functionality from the base distribution
into extension packages.
</LI>
</OL>
GEM works on Linux/Unix, MacOS X and Win32 (Cygwin and MINGW) systems.
There are some OS specific issues which are discussed in the appendix.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
2 How Does GEM Work?</A>
</H1>

<P>
The GEM program itself is a relatively simple frontend written in
ANSI C that interacts with more complex installation scripts (make
system) contained in each individual extension package. These scripts
are a scaled-down and slightly modified version of the original GRASS
6 make system. Files in an extension package correspond 1:1 with the
layout of the original GRASS source tree, the only difference being
that an extension package only contains source code for the add-on
modules plus a few things that are needed to setup the source code,
parse HTML documentation etc.

<P>
A GRASS extension is essentially a minimal replication of the GRASS
source tree including all necessary makefiles. It contains only the
source code for a few modules that constitute the extensions. On the
top level, you will find a number of ASCII files that contain the
information gem needs to manage the extension. All information is
managed in plain ASCII format. 

<P>
Installed extensions will be registered in <I>$(PATH_TO_GRASS)/etc/extensions.db</I>.
This registry file also contains version and dependencies information.
Each extension should also provide an uninstall script to be run when
the user wants to get rid of that extension. 

<P>
They are stored in <I>$(PATH_TO_GRASS)/etc/uninstall.&lt;extension_name&gt;</I>. 

<P>
Extension may add a submenu to the GIS Manager. The first extension
installed creates an additional &#34;Xtns&#34; top level
menu under which each extension can register a nested submenu. 

<P>
Gem modifies $<I>(PATH_TO_GRASS)/etc/d.m/menu.tcl</I> for this. 

<P>
The extension source code is in the <I>src</I> directory, along with
all the necessary makefiles. Other directories may hold pre-compiled
binaries and should be named appropriately (<I>win32</I>, <I>macosx</I>,
...). 

<P>
Extensions may provide code for C language modules and libraries,
scripts and HTML documentation. 

<P>
GEM compiles and install add-on modules using the sources and makefiles
contained in the extension.

<P>
For the user, GEM is really simple to use. All that is required is
a download of the extension package to install and knowledge of where
the local GRASS installation resides. If the user does not have permission
to install new files in the GRASS installation directory, a password
for a user with sufficient permissions will be required (see next
section).

<P>
Developers of add-on modules will (hopefully) also find the process
of migrating their work to a GEM extension package a matter of minutes
and well worth the effort. More information for developers can be
found in section <A HREF="#sec:Developing-Extensions-for">4</A> of this document.

3 Installation and Usage</A>
</H1>

<P>
Note: in addition to GEM itself, you will probably want to install
GNU C compiler and maketools for compilation. Tar, gzip, unzip, bunzip2
for handling various archive formats. Wget for fetching extensions
from the internet.

3.1 Program Installation
</H2>

<P>
You can download GEM source code and binaries for several different
platforms from the author's homepage (http://www.uni-kiel.de/ufg/index1.htm).
Check the links at the bottom of the page. You will also find several
extension packages for installation with GEM.

<P>
Download the file <I>gem-someversion.tar.gz</I> to a convenient location,
unpack it and change into the newly created directory:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>tar&nbsp;-xzvf&nbsp;gem-<I>someversion</I>.tar.gz

<P>
cd&nbsp;gem-<I>someversion</I>
</DD>
</DL>In this directory, you will find a folder <I>bin</I> that contains
binaries for different platforms. Change into it and list its contents:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>cd&nbsp;bin

<P>
ls
</DD>
</DL>You will see a number of programs. Pick the one that corresponds to
your OS and start it. E.g., if you are working in a cygwin environment
under Windows, do:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>./gem-cygwin.exe
</DD>
</DL>You should get a text explaining the program's options on your screeen.

<P>
If you want (and have the required permissions), you can copy the
file to a directory for system-wide binaries so you can call GEM from
anywhere without having to prefix a directory path (./ in the example
above) by typing just <TT>gem</TT>:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>cp&nbsp;gem-cygwin.exe&nbsp;/usr/local/bin/gem
</DD>
</DL>Once GEM has reached a stable release version (1.0), it will also
become part of the GRASS CVS version. If you download and install
such a version on your computer, you will automatically have GEM available
system-wide (usually <I>/usr/local/bin</I>) and can just start it
with:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>gem64
</DD>
</DL>Instructions on how to user GEM to install an actual extension are
given in section <A HREF="#sub:Basic-Usage">3.4</A>.

Note: if configuration fails, this is likely due to your operating
system missing some external default software (such as the PostgreSQL
database). You can use GEM's {}``- -configure='' option to pass the
same options that you passed to the GRASS configuration script (use
quotation marks for more than one option), e.g. - -configure='- -with-nls
- -without-postgres' will configure the extension to use national language
support but not try to find the PostgreSQL software.%

<P>
To finish the installation, GEM needs to write the extension's new
module files into the directory where GRASS has been installed. In
many cases, this will be a system directory with restricted write
access. Provide the superuser password if GEM asks you for it. Restart
GIS Manager and look in the ``Xtns'' menu for new modules (some
modules may not provide GIS Manager entries). If anything goes wrong
or confuses you: read the rest of this section!

This section will show you how to use GEM to perform basic things:
installing, querying and removing (un-installing) extensions for GRASS
GIS. For the sake of simplicity, I will assume that your GRASS installation
resides in <I>/usr/local/grass-6.0.0</I> and you may have to adjust
this path in the examples below, so that it reflects your individual
setup (Mac OS X users: see notes on system specific issues in section
<A HREF="#sub:Mac-OS-X">A.1</A> for how to find the path to your installation).
Also, the extension package used in the following examples is called
<I>RasterTools.tar.gz</I> and is in ``tar'd gzip'' format. Replace
this with the name of the extension you wish to install as needed.

<P>
I will further assume that you (or your system's administrator) have
copied the executable <I>gem64</I> into a directory from where it can
be started system-wide (such as <I>/usr/local/bin</I>) without having
to prefix the path to the executable (see instructions in <A HREF="#sub:Program-Installation">3.1</A>).

<P>
<!-- MATH
 $\framebox{\begin{minipage}[t][1\totalheight]{1\columnwidth}%
Note: in order to install extensions that do not provide binaries,
you need to have a C compiler (preferably GNU CC) and make tools installed.
Please refer to the OS specific section A for more details.
\par
For unpacking extension packages you need the appropriate software.
Depending on the format of the archive, this could be \emph{tar},
\emph{gzip}, \emph{bunzip2} and \emph{unzip}.
\par
If you want to get extensions from an internet source (http or ftp),
you also need \emph{wget}. These programs will very likely already
be installed on your system. If not, you will find it easy to locate
a copy for your OS using an internet search engine.%

<P>
GEM understands short and long options. Long options are just a more
legible version of the short options, which is why I will use them
in this document. E.g. ``-i'' is a short option that does exactly
the same as ``-install=''. To see all options, short and long,
simply call GEM without any options or ``-help'':

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>gem64
</DD>
</DL>The ``-version'' action shows information about the GEM version
you are using.

<P>
You will notice that GEM knows a special sort of options called ``actions''
this are options that cause GEM to operate in some way on the extension.
The regular ``options'' are just used to modify the way GEM works.

<P>
To install a module into your GRASS installation (in this example
<I>/usr/local/grass-6.0.0</I>), simply pass the name of the archive
containing the extension or the directory with the unpacked files
to the ``-install='' action and supply the path to the GRASS
installation for which you wish to install the extension (using the
``-grass='' option): 

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>gem64&nbsp;-grass=/usr/local/grass-6.0.0&nbsp;-install=RasterTools.tar.gz
</DD>
</DL>If everything goes well, you will see a few messages on the screen
and after a short while the program will inform you that it is done.
If you do not have permission to write into the system-wide GRASS
installation directory, you will be asked for the password of the
user owning the GRASS binary files. 

<P>
If any errors occur, use option ``-v'' (``-verbose'') to
see what is going on. 

<P>
By default, the ``-install='' action performs an installation
from source code. This will first configure the sources for your system's
individual setup, then compile the source code into binaries, finally
install them in the appropriate locations.

<P>
<!-- MATH
 $\framebox{\begin{minipage}[t][1\totalheight]{1\columnwidth}%
Note: an extension may also provide shell scripts that do not need
to be compiled. Installation does, however, by default work in the
same way. Look for the keyword {}``scripts'' in the extension details
(under {}``Binary installation files'') by querying it as discussed
in section 3.5 on installation of binaries. If it exists, you can
perform a binary install (again, see section 3.5) for {}``scripts'',
skipping configuration and compilation steps and avoiding the need
to have C development tools installed. %

<P>
If you invoke GEM from inside a running GRASS session, you can ommit
the ``-grass='' option. GEM will then automatically install the
extension into the GRASS installation that is currently running. We
will assume this to be true for the following usage examples, as it
saves me some typing work (...). 

<P>
The new modules provided by the extension should be available to you
immediately from within a GRASS session. The extension will be registered
as ``RasterTools''. To get a list of newly installed GRASS modules:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>gem64&nbsp;-query=RasterTools
</DD>
</DL>This will display all sorts of information about your freshly installed
extension, including the installed modules (under ``Commands provided'').

Some extensions may provide menu entries for a GRASS GUI. Currently,
<I>d.m</I> and <I>gis.m</I> are supported by GEM. Both of these GUIs
need to be restarted. If the extension provides menu entries, you
will find them under ``Xtns'' in the main menu bar.

3.5 Installation of Pre-compiled Binary Extension Files
</H2>

<P>
Some extensions may provide pre-compiled binary files for one or more
operating systems. A user wishing to install an extension that provides
binaries for his OS does not need to have C development tools installed.
This may frequently be the case for users of Mac OS X and Cygwin (but
see OS specific issues in section <A HREF="#sec:OS-Specific-Issues">A</A>).

<P>
It is recommended for all users of GRASS and GEM to install C development
tools and install extensions from sources (the regular way as described
in section <A HREF="#sub:Basic-Usage">3.4</A>). This will compile the source code
into custom binaries that are optimally tailored to your system. However,
there may be circumstances that make using pre-compiled binaries appear
more convenient or even unavoidable.

<P>
You can check whether an extension provides such pre-compiled binary
files for your OS by querying the extension package:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>gem64&nbsp;-query=RasterTools.tar.gz
</DD>
</DL>If any binaries are provided, they will be listed under &#34;Binary
installation files&#34;. You should be able to see whether they
are suitable for your system from the names. E.g. ``cygwin'' would
provide binaries for Cygwin users (see section <A HREF="#sub:Developers_-Guidelines">4.12</A>
for conventional names of binaries for different OS).

<P>
Use the option &#34;-binary=&#34; in conjunction with the
&#34;-install=&#34; action to install the binaries you
deem right:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>gem64&nbsp;-binary=cygwin&nbsp;-install=RasterTools.tar.gz
</DD>
</DL>This process should finish quicker than regular installation from
source code as it will skip source code configuration and compilation.

<P>
If you have chosen a wrong set of binaries, new commandes will simply
fail to start when you try to use them.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00046000000000000000">
3.6 Additional Options</A>

Option ``-f'' (``-force'') can be used to force GEM to re-install

This is not a recommended thing to do! There is currently no clean
updating mechanism for GEM, so you are advised to first de-install
the existing extension (which might involve de-installing all dependent
extensions first), then install freshly.

Information about all installed extensions is stored in the file <I>etc/extensions.db</I>
in your system-wide GRASS installation directory. This file contains
the names, versions and <I>dependencies</I> of all installed extensions.
Some extensions may need another extension or a particular GRASS version
to be installed before it can function properly. If an extension's
dependencies are not met, GEM will abort the installation and you
need to first install all required software.

<P>
Querying an extension package will let you see the dependencies it

<P>
You can force installation of extensions with unmatched dependencies
by using the &#34;-force&#34; option. This is not a recommended
thing to do! 

<P>
GEM also guards against de-installation of extensions that are still
needed by other extensions still present on the system. You need to
un-install all dependent extension in reverse order of installation
first.

<P>
There is currently no clean updating mechanism for GEM, so you are
advised to first un-install an existing extension (which might involve

<P>
The skeleton package (see section <A HREF="#sub:The-Skeleton-Package">4.2</A>)
is an almost complete GRASS extension. Use this as a template for
starting new extensions or migrating existing source code from the
GRASS source tree. All you need to do is copy your source files, scripts
etc. into the appropriate places in the <I>src</I> directory (you
will find that everything mirrors the way GRASS sources are organized)
and fill necessary information into the toplevel ASCII files.

<P>
GEM can configure, compile and install extensions from a plain directory.
Just provide the name of the directory for all actions. This allows
you to conveniently keep all your sources and documentations in a
small, portable directory outside the GRASS source tree and maintain
everything in there.

<P>
You can test whether an extension compiles and installs on your system
by using the ``-test='' action. This will perform all steps except
for actually copying the files to their destinations.

4.2 The Skeleton Package

The skeleton package is an almost complete GRASS extension. Use this

code from the GRASS source tree. All you need to do is copy your source
files, scripts etc. into the appropriate places in the <I>src</I>
directory (you will find that everything mirrors the way GRASS sources
are organized) and fill necessary information into the toplevel ASCII
files (see following sections).

<P>
You will find the skeleton package files in the subdirectory <I>$GISBASE/etc/gem/skeleton</I>
(replace <I>$GISBASE</I> with the path to your GRASS 6.1 install,
e.g. <I>/usr/local/grass-6.1.cvs</I>).

<P>
Look into the skeleton extension directory and open the ASCII files
with a texteditor of your choice. You will find lots of comments that
help you make sense of their contents. You can put comments starting
with &#34;#&#34; at the beginning of a line or at the end
in any file. These will be filtered out upon parsing of the file by
GEM.

<P>
The skeleton contains a copy of the GPL as the default license. Creators
of new extensions need to be aware of this! Either insert the name
of your extension at the end of that license or provide your own custom
licensing information.

<P>
A number of ASCII files in the toplevel extension directory store

4.7 Providing GUI Hooks
</H2>

<P>
GEM currently supports the installation of menu items for GIS Manager:
the old version (<I>d.m</I>) and the new on (<I>gis.m</I>) are both
support. Support for <I>d.m</I> menus is quite limited. You can only
create one submenu and any number of menu items and separators inside
of it. Menus for <I>gis.m</I> can contain any tk menu code. You can
have as many levels of menu hierarchy as you like. See the examples
in the skeleton extension to learn how they are organized.

<P>
The file responsible for creating <I>d.m</I> menu entries is <I>entries-gisman</I>.
For <I>gis.m</I> it is <I>entries-gisman2</I>. For <I>d.m</I> menus,
<I>entries-gisman</I> is directly merged into <I>$GISBASE/etc/dm/menu.tcl</I>.
GEM will also place a copy of the original <I>entries-gisman</I> file
into <I>$GISBASE/etc/dm/gem-entries</I>. This is used by the ``-restore''
action to restore <I>d.m</I> menus in case the user updates the GRASS
installation and menu.tcl gets overwritten. For the purpose of un-installation,
markers are stored as comments at the end of <I>menu.tcl</I>. This
allows the ``-uninstall='' action to find an extensions menu
entries and delete them. The file <I>menu.tcl</I> will be backed up
as <I>menu.tcl.gem.bak</I> so a user can restore it if anything should
wrong.

<P>
Things work much simpler for <I>gis.m</I>. In this case, <I>$GISBASE/etc/gm/gmmenu.tcl</I>
dynamically re-builds the ``Xtns'' menu upon start-up. If <I>entries-gisman2</I>
exists in an extension package, GEM will make sure to create an directory
<I>Xtns</I> in <I>$GISBASE/etc/gm/</I> and copies <I>entries-gisman2</I>
into it, renaming it to the extension's name. From these files, <I>gis.m</I>
will automatically build the ``Xtns'' menu via some parsing code
in <I>gmmenu.tcl</I>.

<P>
Your submenu will be sorted in under the &#34;Xtns&#34;
menu in alphabetical position according to either the name of the
top level menu item (<I>d.m</I>) or the extension name (<I>gis.m</I>)
it is smart to keep both the same (see guidelines in section <A HREF="#sub:Developers_-Guidelines">4.12</A>).

4.8 Customizing the configure script</A>
</H2>

<P>
If an extension is to be installed from source code, it needs to be
configured first. This is done by the script <I>configure</I> in the
<I>src</I> directory of the extension package. The original GRASS
configure script checks the system for a number of optional dependencies,
such as PostgreSQL or Tcl/Tk which are not strictly required to run
GRASS but may greatly enhance the sytem's functionality. Certain GRASS
modules may or may not be compiled depending on what optional sofware
is installed on the system (and correctly detected by the configure
script). In certain situations (such as a missing PostgreSQL installation),
the GRASS configure script will fail and compilation not start unless
the user specifies explicitly that e.g. PostgreSQL support is not
wanted.

<P>
If one or more modules of an extension need a certain external software
dependency to be satisfied, the extension author needs to modify the
configure script of that extension accordingly.

<P>
E.g. if PostgreSQL is an absolute requirement for all modules and
configure should fail in case it cannot be found, set the option

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>with_postgres=yes
</DD>
</DL>in the configure script for your extension (options start at ca. line
2600). Other dependencies might require more complicated modifications
to <I>configure</I>.

<P>
Arbitrary options can be passed to an extensions <I>configure</I>
script using GEM's ``-config-opts='' option.

<P>
The default configure script, that ships with the skeleton extension
has all optional dependencies disabled (ca. line 2600 and following
of the configure script). The check for the proj program and libraries
(mandatory for GRASS 6.1) has been completely removed. If your extension
code calls proj directly, you may want to add this part of the configure
script back in.

If not done yet, unpack the extension files into a directory:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>tar&nbsp;-xzvf&nbsp;extensionname.tar.gz
</DD>
</DL>Compile the extension under the OS that you wish to prepare binaries
for (see OS specific issues in section <A HREF="#sec:OS-Specific-Issues">A</A>
about the additional software you may need to do this). You do not
need to install, compilation will suffice (don't worry if you get
an error message about the extension being already installed):

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>./gem64&nbsp;-grass=pathToGRASS&nbsp;-t&nbsp;extensionName
</DD>
</DL>If the compilation was successful, you will find two new folders in
the <I>src</I> directory of the extension directory: <I>bin.architecture-osname</I>
and <I>dist.architecture-osname</I>. E.g. for a Windows/Cygwin compilation
the ``dist'' directory will frequently be

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>dist.i686-pc-cygwin
</DD>
</DL>(or similar). 

<P>
Create a new directory on the same level as the <I>src</I> directory.
For an appropriate name, follow the guidelines in section <A HREF="#sub:Developers_-Guidelines">4.12</A>.
In our Cygwin example, this would be <I>cygwin</I>. In this directory:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>move the <I>dist.architecture-osname</I> directory here
</LI>
<LI>copy <I>src/Makefile</I> here
</LI>
<LI>copy <I>src/include</I> (with all subdirectories) here
</LI>
</OL>
Make a slight modification to the copy of Makefile: at the top of
the file following the definitions for install directories (BINDIR=,
INST_DIR=). Add another line that reads:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>GISBASE&nbsp;=&nbsp;<I>dist.architecture-osname</I>
</DD>
</DL>For our example, this might be:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>GISBASE&nbsp;=&nbsp;dist.i686-pc-cygwin
</DD>
</DL>(or similar). This makes sure that the install command will install
binaries from the right directory.

<P>
Now, since we are preparing a binary distribution for the sake of
people who do not have any development tools installed, we need to
supply them with a copy of the GNU make tools, since this is the tool
that will take care of the actual installation. What we need is really
just the program <I>make</I>. We will copy it into a folder <I>bin</I>
under our new directory. In our example, then the copy would go into
<I>cygwin/bin</I>.

<P>
The skeleton extension package already has copies of <I>make</I> for
Cygwin and Mac OS X in place. If you need them for another architecture,
download sources from http://www.gnu.org/software/make/ and
compile the appropriate binaries.

<P>
GEM is not very well-suited to install add-ons consisting of just
a single module. This would need an entire extension with the whole
shebang for a single module! I is assumed, that people who program
for a GIS as a rule produce more than just one module for a certain
purose and that these can well be grouped into extensions.

Please do not use anything fancy for your extension's name (as stored

no special characters, no whitespaces (including simple ``space'').

The recommended way to package an extension is to use GNU <I>tar</I>

gets users annoyed because the files will get decompressed directly
into whatever directory the extension was compiled and it will be
hard to clean up the mess. Also, do not use an absolute path to the
files. Rather, build the archive from the directory that contains
your extension directory, as shown in the example above.

Some additional hints about setting up Cygwin:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Make sure you set the ``Default Text File Type'' to ``Unix''
during Setup.
</LI>
<LI>If you want to be able to use any extension package, not only those
that provide binaries for Cygwin, jsut install everything in the ``Devel''
category and you will have a complete development system.
</LI>
<LI>If you want to be able install extension packages directly from the
internet (http or ftp sources) using GEM, make sure to install wget,
located the ``Network'' category.
</LI>
<LI>If you want to use an installation in a network environment with NT
domain authentication, you may need to update <I>cygwin1.dll</I> to
a newer version. Download from http://cygwin.com/snapshots/
and replace the old version in your system search path.
</LI>
</UL>
Under Cygwin, there is no support for the Unix <I>su</I> command.
This means that installation of extensions has to be done by someone
with appropriate access rights to the GRASS installation directory
inside the Cygwin installation directory (e.g. if you installed cygwin
to <I>C:&#92;cygwin</I>, this would be something like <I>C:&#92;cygwin&#92;usr&#92;local&#92;grass-someversion</I>).

B..4 Current Bugs and Shortcomings</A>
</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Operation under Cygwin only works in verbose mode (option -v)!
</LI>
<LI>querying installed extensions or trying to uninstall an extension
on a system that never had an extension installed will simply segfault
(missing extensions.db is not handled gracefully)
</LI>
<LI>Installation from an internet source currently quits with ``shell-init:
error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories:
No such file or directory'' (may leave some temp files around?)
</LI>
<LI>Binary installation mode is not exhaustively tested.
</LI>
<LI>The installation of menu items for the old <I>d.m</I> GUI is very
sensitive to the precise syntax of <I>menu.tcl</I>. If the user has
altered this file substantially it is likely that registering the
extension submenu entries will fail.
</LI>
<LI>There is no clean way to upgrade an existing extension and respecting
dependencies <I>automatically</I>. You can use option ``-f'' or
``-force'' to force over-writing of an extension, but it is safer
to uninstall first, then install the new version. 
</LI>
<LI>GEM can only manage system-wide installations of extension. There
is no support for location or mapset-wide management.
</LI>
<LI>path to GRASS dynamic libraries needs to be present in system-wider
linker paths.
</LI>
</UL>
