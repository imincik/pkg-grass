Hamish Bowman, Radim Blazek, and others listed in AUTHORS, except for a few from the
BWidgets set distributed with GRASS (see file AUTHORS for a list of icon authors)

NOTES

These are gif icons. (Tcl doesn't like PNG)

They are installed in $(GISBASE)/etc/gui/icons

They follow the following naming scheme:
[class]-[member].gif

The following classes are being used:


ELEMENT

These are icons for grass database elements such as cell, rast3, vector,
windows, etc. and for symbol, the other type of thing that the tcl GSelect
procedure handles.


MODULE

Members of module are programs or parts of programs. For example
module-d.nviz.gif. The program name can consist of just the first few '.'
seperated parts of the name. For example module-r.gif could be used for
all raster programs. The last . must be removed; module-v.in..gif won't
match anything.


GUI

Icons used by gui.tcl.
gui-cmd.gif is needed for one version of gui.tcl


FILE

Icons for file operations like open, close, etc.
file-open.gif is needed for one version of gui.tcl


EDIT

Icons for edit operations like cut, copy, paste, etc.
edit-copy.gif is needed for one version of gui.tcl


STATUS

Status icons for grass. Any lowercase key to GRASS_INFO_*, like warning,
error, message. Also success and failure for exit codes.


CHANNEL
